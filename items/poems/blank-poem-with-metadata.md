# Compos’d by Chloe a negro girl

	The World to me was a choice bit
Now Christ to me is choicer yet
Since I do know his Will and Ways
My duty is to sing his praise

	I long to tread my Saviours steps
Tho’ from the water I am kept
Still year by year, I’m kept away
From doing God’s commands, I say,

	Why should the Nations angry be
‘Cause Christ has set a Negro free
Tho’ I’m a servant all my days
He’s freed my Soul to love his ways.

	Now all the world may plainly see
That I love Christ that Died for me
His limbs did ach, he sigh and grown
That he might bring my Soul safe home
